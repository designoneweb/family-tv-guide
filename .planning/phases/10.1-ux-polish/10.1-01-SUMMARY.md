# Plan 10.1-01 Summary: UX Polish

## Status: COMPLETE

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Tonight screen - episode still with navigation
**Commit:** `675b8db`

Modified TitleCard component to:
- Use episode still (16:9) instead of poster when currentEpisode exists with stillPath
- Make image clickable: TV shows with currentEpisode link to episode detail page
- Fallback to poster when no still available
- Dynamic aspect ratio class based on image type (aspect-video for stills, aspect-[2/3] for posters)

**Files changed:**
- `web/components/title-card.tsx`

### Task 2: Make provider logos clickable
**Commit:** `8593b9c`

Updated ProviderLogos component and schedule API to:
- Add optional `link?: string` to Provider interface
- Wrap provider logo images in anchor tags when link is provided
- Add hover effect (opacity + scale) for clickable indication
- Pass TMDB JustWatch link from watch provider response to each provider

**Files changed:**
- `web/components/provider-logos.tsx`
- `web/app/api/schedule/route.ts`

### Task 3: Enrich show detail page header
**Commit:** `74dcea6`

Enhanced show detail page with comprehensive header:
- Added TMDBTVCredits type and getTVCredits function for series cast
- Created `/api/tmdb/tv/[id]/credits` endpoint for TV show credits
- Created `/api/tmdb/tv/[id]/providers` endpoint for watch providers
- Fetch credits and providers in parallel with show details
- Added header section displaying:
  - Rating with star icon
  - Year range (with ongoing indicator for active shows)
  - Season count
  - Genre list
  - Streaming provider logos (clickable)
  - Full synopsis
  - Horizontally scrollable cast section (top 10 members)
- Cast cards link to person detail pages

**Files changed:**
- `web/lib/tmdb/types.ts`
- `web/lib/tmdb/details.ts`
- `web/app/api/tmdb/tv/[id]/credits/route.ts` (new)
- `web/app/api/tmdb/tv/[id]/providers/route.ts` (new)
- `web/app/app/show/[id]/show-client.tsx`

## Verification

- [x] `cd web && npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [x] Tonight screen shows episode stills (not posters) for TV shows with progress
- [x] Clicking episode image on Tonight navigates to episode detail page
- [x] Provider logos are clickable and open JustWatch/streaming service
- [x] Show detail page shows synopsis before seasons
- [x] Show detail page shows rating
- [x] Show detail page shows streaming providers
- [x] Show detail page shows main cast

## Deviations

None. All tasks completed as specified.

## Notes

- The provider link from TMDB points to JustWatch, which provides deep links to actual streaming services
- Cast cards reuse the same CastCard pattern from episode-client.tsx but with slightly smaller dimensions (w-24 vs w-28) to fit more cast in the viewport
- Credits and providers fetch in parallel with show details for optimal loading performance
