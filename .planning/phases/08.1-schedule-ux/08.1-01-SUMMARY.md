# Phase 8.1 Plan 01: Schedule UX Improvement Summary

**Simplified schedule grid with title + episode info, full episode details in dialog with still image linking to episode page**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-19T20:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-19T20:42:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Schedule grid now displays title + episode number (S#E#) without poster thumbnails
- Dialog shows full episode details for TV shows: still image, title, overview, air date, runtime
- Episode runtime comes from actual TMDB episode data instead of show average
- Episode still image in dialog links to full episode detail page

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update schedule API to use actual episode runtime** - `6da5562` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Simplify ShowBlock to show title + episode only** - `f2afb11` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Update dialog to show full episode details** - `dad3937` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `web/app/api/schedule/route.ts` - Added runtime, airDate, overview to CurrentEpisode; use episode-specific runtime
- `web/app/app/schedule/schedule-client.tsx` - Removed poster thumbnail, show title + episode number
- `web/components/schedule-show-dialog.tsx` - Episode-focused layout for TV shows with still image link

## Decisions Made

- Episode still image links to episode detail page for deeper navigation
- Fallback to show poster when no episode still available from TMDB
- TV shows get episode-focused layout; movies keep poster-focused layout

## Deviations from Plan

### User-Requested Enhancement

**1. Episode still image should link to episode detail page**
- **Found during:** Checkpoint verification
- **Request:** User requested the episode still in dialog link to full episode details
- **Fix:** Wrapped still image in Link component with hover effects
- **Files modified:** web/components/schedule-show-dialog.tsx
- **Committed in:** dad3937 (amended)

## Issues Encountered

None - plan executed as specified with one user-requested enhancement.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Schedule UX improvements complete
- Ready to proceed with Phase 9 (Person Pages)
